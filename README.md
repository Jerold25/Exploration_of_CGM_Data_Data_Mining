# Exploration_of_CGM_Data_Data_Mining
Project - CSE 572 - Data Mining

## Project Description

The outline of this course is to implement
a project which involves practical methods about the basic
concepts of data mining and pattern recognition. This project is
divided into three modules. Each of the modules requires basic
tasks for preparing the datasets and calculating time series features
for extracting information. These tasks include loading libraries,
data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature scaling. The
techniques used in these tasks are elaborated below in detail. The
following are the modules to be implemented and the tasks involved
in each module.

* Module I: Principal Component Analysis - This module
involves the extraction of features from the given datasets
and performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the
feature matrix to find the top features in the dataset.

* Module II: Classification - This module implements six
different machine learning algorithms for data classification,
calculates performance metrics and also performs K-fold
cross-validation for the given dataset.

* Module III: Clustering - This module implements two data
clustering algorithms: K-means and DB-SCAN, labeling the
data to form groups and plotting the predicted cluster groups.
